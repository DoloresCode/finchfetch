It's a common source of post-injury or surgical infections, affecting approximately 500,000 patients in American hospitals annually. This bacterium is present in all mammalian species and can transmit between species. Around 30 pourcent of healthy humans carry S. aureus in their nose, throat, and skin. Though S. aureus is carried by one-third of healthy individuals, it generally doesn't cause disease unless there's a break in the skin or other entry sites. It's considered an opportunistic bacterium, causing infections when the opportunity arises, particularly in immunocompromised or immunodeficient individuals. S. aureus can cause a variety of conditions, from minor skin infections to life-threatening diseases such as pneumonia, meningitis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, toxic shock syndrome, bacteremia, and sepsis. Diagnosis can be challenging due to the bacteria's prevalence on the skin, nose, and throat of humans and animals. However, it can be identified via culture of suspicious lesions, presenting as characteristic yellow to white colonies on blood agar.", "Manifestations: Staphylococcus aureus, often shortened to S. aureus, can lead to a number of health problems. These include: 1/ Skin Infections & Surgical wound infections, 2/ Osteomyelitis, 3/ Food poisoning/gastroenteritis, 4/ Toxic shock syndrome, 5/ Pneumonia (mainly hospital-acquired), 6/ Acute endocarditis, 7/ Infective arthritis, 8/ Necrotizing fasciitis, 9/ Sepsis and Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS)", "Laboratory_diagnosis: The laboratory diagnosis of a Staphylococcus aureus infection includes: 1/ Gram staining: Gram-positive cocci in clusters, cocci may appear singly in pairs or in short chains. 2/ Sample Collection: Depending on the suspected infection site, a sample (like a swab or blood) is collected. 3/ Culture and Identification: - Blood Agar: The sample is cultured on blood agar. After incubation for 18 to 24 hours, S. aureus typically forms round, golden-yellow colonies with or without beta hemolysis. - Mannitol Salt Agar (MSA): This selective medium is also used for isolation of S. aureus. After inoculation, MSA plates are incubated at 35Â°C for 24 to 48 hours. S. aureus, being a mannitol fermenting bacterium, forms yellow or gold colonies on MSA.4/ Gram Stain and Catalase Test: S. aureus is Gram-positive (stains purple) and catalase-positive (produces bubbles when mixed with hydrogen peroxide). 5/ Coagulase Test: S. aureus produces an enzyme called coagulase that causes blood plasma to clot. 6/ Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing: This test identifies which antibiotics the bacteria are sensitive to, guiding treatment. 7/ Molecular Testing: Techniques like PCR may be used for further identification or to detect virulence factors or antibiotic resistance genes."),
    Microorganism("Enterococcus faecalis", "https://microbe-canvas.com/uploads/image/bacterien/enterococcus-faecalis/enterococcus-faecalis_bk_gram-2_f-350x220.jpg", "Characteristics: 1/ Gram-positive, 2/ cocci, 3/ diplococci, 4/ growth both-aerobic-and-anaerobic, 5/ catalase-negative, 6/ oxidase-negative, 7/ phrase-positive, 8/ vancomycin-susceptible, 9/ penicillin-resistant, 10/ esculin-positive, 11/ bile-tolerance, 12/ NaCl 6.5%-tolerance", "Description: Enterococci, including species such as Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, are gram-positive bacteria commonly found in soil, food, water, and as part of the normal flora in animals and humans. They are particularly prevalent in the human gastrointestinal and female genitourinary tracts. Enterococci can cause infections when they gain access to sterile sites in the body, often during gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures. They are especially significant in hospital settings, where they can be transmitted person-to-person or via contaminated medical equipment. Enterococcus faecalis is a notable cause of hospital-acquired urinary tract infections and endocarditis.These bacteria have a variety of virulence factors, such as cytolysin/hemolysin, which can lyse red blood cells, and aggregation substances that promote clumping of cells and facilitate the transfer of drug resistance.Treatment of enterococcal infections usually involves a combination of penicillin or ampicillin and an aminoglycoside such as gentamicin. This regimen is typically effective due to their synergistic effect, as penicillin or vancomycin can weaken the bacterial cell wall, allowing the aminoglycoside to penetrate. In cases of resistance, vancomycin is used, and linezolid is an option for treating vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Preventive measures include administering penicillin and gentamicin to patients with damaged heart valves prior to certain procedures. As of now, there is no vaccine available for enterococci.", "Manifestations: Enterococci, due to their intrinsic and increased drug resistance, are primarily responsible for hospital-acquired (nosocomial) infections. They can cause a variety of conditions including urinary tract infections (such as cystitis, urethritis, pyelonephritis, and prostatitis), blood infections (bacteremia), and life-threatening heart infections (mitral valve endocarditis). They may also lead to intra-abdominal, pelvic, and soft tissue infections, eye infections, and rarely, meningitis and respiratory tract infections.", "Laboratory Diagnosis: ")
