## Problem Finchfetch Microorganisms Solves
This platform brings together all the information on microorganisms in one place, serving as a comprehensive database for anyone working on or interested in microorganisms. It saves time by centralizing information and making it easily accessible.

## Who would use it

The Finchfetch Microorganisms database is widely used by researchers studying microbial diversity and by teachers for biology lessons. It also serves as a valuable resource for students and enthusiasts interested in microorganisms.

## Future updates

- [ ] **Advanced Search and Filter Features:** Expand the search functionality to allow users to filter microorganisms based on various criteria such as their type, characteristics, and clinical manifestations. This will make it even easier for users to find specific information.

- [ ] **User Accounts and Personalization:** Implement user accounts where users can save their favorite microorganisms, create personalized lists, or even add personal notes or observations. This would greatly improve the user experience by allowing for customization and providing personalized content.

- [ ] **Community Features:** Create a space where users can share their own findings, discuss with peers, or ask questions to the community. This could range from a simple comment section on each microorganism's page, to a fully-fledged forum. The goal would be to make the platform not only a database but also a community for sharing and learning from each other.
