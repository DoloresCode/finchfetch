It's a common source of post-injury or surgical infections, affecting approximately 500,000 patients in American hospitals annually. This bacterium is present in all mammalian species and can transmit between species. Around 30 pourcent of healthy humans carry S. aureus in their nose, throat, and skin. Though S. aureus is carried by one-third of healthy individuals, it generally doesn't cause disease unless there's a break in the skin or other entry sites. It's considered an opportunistic bacterium, causing infections when the opportunity arises, particularly in immunocompromised or immunodeficient individuals. S. aureus can cause a variety of conditions, from minor skin infections to life-threatening diseases such as pneumonia, meningitis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, toxic shock syndrome, bacteremia, and sepsis. Diagnosis can be challenging due to the bacteria's prevalence on the skin, nose, and throat of humans and animals. However, it can be identified via culture of suspicious lesions, presenting as characteristic yellow to white colonies on blood agar.", "Manifestations: Staphylococcus aureus, often shortened to S. aureus, can lead to a number of health problems.

They are particularly prevalent in the human gastrointestinal and female genitourinary tracts. Enterococci can cause infections when they gain access to sterile sites in the body, often during gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures. They are especially significant in hospital settings, where they can be transmitted person-to-person or via contaminated medical equipment. Enterococcus faecalis is a notable cause of hospital-acquired urinary tract infections and endocarditis.These bacteria have a variety of virulence factors, such as cytolysin/hemolysin, which can lyse red blood cells, and aggregation substances that promote clumping of cells and facilitate the transfer of drug resistance.Treatment of enterococcal infections usually involves a combination of penicillin or ampicillin and an aminoglycoside such as gentamicin. This regimen is typically effective due to their synergistic effect, as penicillin or vancomycin can weaken the bacterial cell wall, allowing the aminoglycoside to penetrate. In cases of resistance, vancomycin is used, and linezolid is an option for treating vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). Preventive measures include administering penicillin and gentamicin to patients with damaged heart valves prior to certain procedures. As of now, there is no vaccine available for enterococci.", "Manifestations: Enterococci, due to their intrinsic and increased drug resistance, are primarily responsible for hospital-acquired (nosocomial) infections. They can cause a variety of conditions including urinary tract infections (such as cystitis, urethritis, pyelonephritis, and prostatitis), blood infections (bacteremia), and life-threatening heart infections (mitral valve endocarditis). They may also lead to intra-abdominal, pelvic, and soft tissue infections, eye infections, and rarely, meningitis and respiratory tract infections.", "Laboratory Diagnosis: In the laboratory, E. faecalis is typically isolated from samples such as urine or pus from infected sites. Identification relies on cultural characteristics, microscopic observation, and biochemical tests. For precise identification and genetic characterization, molecular diagnosis is also used. There is no special requirement for sample collection, transportation, or processing. I - Macroscopy and Culture: Enterococci can be identified through the following features: 1/ They are gram-positive bacteria, appearing as oval shapes organized in pairs with a distinctive angle between them, resembling a 'spectacle-eyed' look. 2/ When cultured on blood agar, they yield smooth, gray, and typically non-hemolytic translucent colonies. However, α or β hemolysis can sometimes occur. 3/ On MacConkey agar, they generate minute magenta pink colonies. 4/ They show poor growth on nutrient agar. 5/ Enterococci can thrive under extreme conditions, including high salt concentrations (6.5% NaCl), high bile content (40%), high pH levels (9.6), and a wide range of temperatures (10°C to 45°C). 6/ They exhibit heat resistance, surviving temperatures of 60°C for up to 30 minutes. 7/ Enterococci are categorized into five groups (I to V) based on mannitol fermentation and arginine hydrolysis characteristics. E.faecalis and E. faecium are part of group II and can be further differentiated by additional biochemical traits. II - Biochemical tests:  They are important for the differentiation and identification of Enterococcus faecalis. To conclusively identify the bacteria as E. faecalis, once it's established as Gram-positive cocci, a sequence of biochemical analyses is performed. Regularly utilized tests include the catalase test, oxidase test, LAP test, and PYR test. The Bile Esculin test, examination of growth in 6.5% NaCl, arginine dihydrolase test, and tests for carbohydrate fermentation (including pyruvate, mannitol, and raffinose) are also commonly employed. Several biochemical tests help differentiate and identify Enterococcus faecalis: 1/ Catalase Test: E. faecalis tests negative, assisting in differentiating it from staphylococci. 2/ Hemolysis: E. faecalis is typically non-hemolytic. 3/ Motility Test: E. faecalis is non-motile. This distinguishes it from E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus, which are motile. 4/ Pyrrolidonyl-β-naphthylamide (PYR) Test: E. faecalis tests positive, enabling presumptive identification of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci and enterococci. 5/ Esculin and Bile-Esculin Test: E. faecalis tests positive (with growth and black precipitate), helping differentiate enterococci from non-enterococcus group D streptococci. 6/ Bile Solubility Test: E. faecalis is insoluble in bile, unlike S. pneumoniae, which is bile soluble. 7/ LAP Test: E. faecalis tests positive, used for identifying catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci. 8/ Pyruvate Broth: E. faecalis tests positive, aiding in differentiating it from E. faecium, which tests negative. 9/ Salt Tolerance Test: E. faecalis tests positive, allowing differentiation between enterococci and non-enterococci. There are also specific features to differentiate between E. faecalis and E. faecium: 1/ Arabinose: E. faecalis does not ferment arabinose, while E. faecium does. 2/ Sorbitol: E. faecalis ferments sorbitol, whereas E. faecium does not. 3/ Pyruvate: E. faecalis ferments pyruvate, unlike E. faecium. III - Molecular Diagnosis: For a quicker and more precise identification, molecular diagnostic techniques such as PCR and sequencing, rRNA sequencing, and Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) are favored. Nonetheless, these methods are rarely utilized in clinical diagnosis.");

Nevertheless, their size is not fixed and can vary based on the medium in which they exist. Cells that grow more rapidly tend to be larger in size,growth both-aerobic-and-anaerobic, catalase-positive, oxidase-negative, indole-positive, urease-negative, TSI no production of H2S, motility nonmotile, vancomycin-resistant, colistine-susceptible, motility-peritrichous, flagella. E. coli has various virulence factors that contribute to its pathogenicity: 1- Pili: These hair-like structures aid the bacteria in attaching to the cells of the jejunum and ileum during intestinal infections and to the urinary tract epithelium during urinary tract infections. 2- Capsule: This outer layer prevents phagocytosis (a type of immune response where cells are engulfed) and plays a significant role in enabling the bacteria to cause systemic infections. 3- Endotoxin (Lipopolysaccharide): This is a key contributor to many symptoms of gram-negative sepsis, including fever, low blood pressure, and a condition called disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), where small blood clots develop throughout the bloodstream. 4- Exotoxins: Among them is the enterotoxin, which targets the cells of the jejunum and ileum, resulting in diarrhea. Other exotoxins include verotoxin and Shiga-like toxin.", "Description: Escherichia coli, often abbreviated as E. coli, is a type of bacteria primarily living in the lower intestines of warm-blooded organisms, including humans. Generally, E. coli is harmless and contributes to a healthy gut flora, even aiding in vitamin K production. However, some strains can cause serious foodborne illnesses. E. coli is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium, and it is facultative anaerobic, meaning it can survive in both oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor environments. Most infections occur when an individual's defenses are compromised, allowing normally benign E. coli to establish infection. Certain E. coli strains have become harmful by gaining elements that increase their virulence, which can be acquired through mechanisms like plasmids, transposons, bacteriophages, or pathogenicity islands. There are four categories of pathogenic intestinal E. coli, classified based on the mechanism by which they cause diarrhea. These include: enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) or verotoxigenic (VTEC), enterotoxigenic (ETEC), enteropathogenic (EPEC), and enteroinvasive (EIEC) or enteroaggregative (EAEC).", "Manifestations:E. coli is the predominant cause of urinary tract infections (UTIs), both within the community and healthcare settings, accounting for more than 75% of all UTI cases. It is also the second most common cause of sepsis induced by Gram-negative bacteria. Newborns can contract a perinatal infection from E. coli during natural birth, if the bacteria are present in the mother's birth canal. This is a leading cause of neonatal meningitis. Enterotoxigenic E. coli, also known as ETEC, is a frequent culprit behind traveler's diarrhea, characterized by watery stools. Bloody diarrhea and a condition known as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) are often caused by enterohemorrhagic strains of E. coli, which produce a shiga toxin.", "Laboratory Diagnosis: I - colony morphologies: 1- MacConkey Agar: E. coli typically ferments lactose and forms pink colonies on MacConkey Agar, giving them a shiny appearance with diameters between 0.5 to 1 mm after an overnight incubation. However, on blood agar plates, the colonies' appearance can range from grey to white, transparent to opaque, and from a raised convex shape to flat. Notably, certain E. coli strains, such as those belonging to the Alkaligens-Dispar group, may not ferment lactose on MacConkey agar. For instance, E. coli O157:H7, which does not ferment sorbitol, is distinguishable from other E. coli strains through this trait. 2- EMB Agar: When cultured on Eosin Methylene Blue (EMB) agar, E. coli produces colonies with a distinctive green metallic sheen.

    Yes. III- Antimicrobial susceptibility testing: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing for E. coli, especially strains producing Extended-spectrum ß-lactamases (ESBL), is performed via the disc-diffusion method. ESBLs are ß-lactamases that can break down third-generation cephalosporins and aztreonam but are blocked by clavulanic acid. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins among E. coli is primarily due to ESBL production. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines state that any E. coli strain with an inhibition zone size of ≤ 22 mm with ceftazidime, ≤ 25 mm with ceftriaxone, and ≤ 27 mm with cefotaxime, should be shortlisted for ESBL confirmation. ESBL confirmation involves two phenotypic methods: the combination disc method and the double disc synergy method. Both methods examine the difference in zone diameters with and without clavulanic acid, and an increase of ≥ 5 mm is a confirmatory sign of ESBL production. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is responsible for a majority of urinary tract infections (UTIs) both in the community and hospitals. Compared to normal E. coli, UPEC strains possess additional virulence factors that enable them to overcome host defenses and establish infection in the urinary tract. These factors include adhesive structures (fimbriae) for attachment, an external capsule (K antigen) for defense against the host immune system, resistance to serum killing, a hemolysin protein toxin, and an aerobactin system to obtain iron.");

It is distinctive in its ability to form yeast, pseudohyphae, or true hyphae, and these adaptations are central to its ability to invade tissues. One unique characteristic of C. albicans is its ability to generate chlamydospores. These are large, thick-walled structures typically measuring 7-13 micrometers in diameter, predominantly found at the ends of hyphae or along pseudohyphae. Though usually a harmless part of the human microbiota, C. albicans can become pathogenic under certain circumstances. Opportunistic infections are more common in hosts with compromised immunity, those experiencing neutropenia, or those receiving broad-spectrum antibiotic or steroid treatments. Invasive medical procedures can also heighten the risk of infection. C. albicans' ability to cause disease is supported by various virulence factors. These include a fibronectin receptor and a hydrophobic molecule on the surface, which promote adherence to the epithelium of the host, aiding its survival within the host. Further, its ability to switch phenotypes and produce aspartyl protease and phospholipase increase its pathogenic potential. In summary, the pathogenesis of C. albicans is primarily attributed to its morphological versatility, opportunistic behavior, and an array of virulence factors that facilitate adherence, colonization, and tissue invasion in the host.", "Manifestations: Candida albicans is implicated in a host of infections affecting both healthy individuals and those with compromised immunity. When C. albicans grows excessively, it can lead to an infection known as thrush, characterized by a white 'cottage cheese-like film.' This acute infection is also known as pseudomembranous candidiasis. Among the various diseases caused by C. albicans, the following are key: 
- Oropharyngeal candidiasis or oral thrush, a common issue among individuals with HIV/AIDS.
- Vulvovaginal candidiasis or vaginal thrush, prevalent in pregnant women and those with diabetes. This infection can arise due to the suppression of vaginal lactobacilli by antimicrobial treatments, leading to an overgrowth of C. albicans and resulting in Candida vaginitis.
- Candidemia or disseminated infections, pneumonia, and meningitis, primarily seen in patients with compromised immunity or serious illness. Other conditions associated with Candida include paronychia, onychomycosis, endocarditis, eye infections, and intertriginous candidiasis.", "Laboratory Diagnosis: Laboratory diagnosis of Candida albicans infection depends on the disease presentation and type of sample collected such as urine, vaginal discharge, CSF, sputum, blood or mucosal exudates. Microscopy can reveal Candida yeast cells in both unstained wet preparations and Gram-stained preparations. In the latter, C. albicans appears as gram-positive budding yeast cells (blastoconidia) or pseudohyphae with regular constriction points. Culture techniques are generally effective for detecting Candida species, and C. albicans grows well on Sabouraud dextrose agar and other common bacteriological media. After 24-48 hours of incubation at 25-37°C, colonies appear as cream-colored and pasty with a distinctive yeast smell. C. albicans can be recognized by hyphal elements radiating from colonies on blood-containing media within 48 hours, resembling 'feet' or stars. These colonies may be mistaken for Staphylococcus spp, hence careful examination, possibly through wet mount or Gram staining, is necessary when analyzing high vaginal swab cultures. The carbohydrate fermentation test can differentiate C. albicans from other Candida species, such as C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. krusei, and C. glabrata. Moreover, a simple germ tube test can presumptively identify C. albicans. Molecular methods, including Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) techniques like the Yeast Traffic Light PNA FISH assay, can identify and differentiate Candida species within an hour from positive blood cultures, providing quick and accurate identification for optimal treatment.");

    Microorganism("Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "https://histopath.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/afb.jpg", "Characteristics: Gram-positive, bacilli, acid-fast, growth obligate-aerobic, no growth on blood agar, catalase-positive, nonmotile. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a bacterium that doesn't conform to traditional Gram-positive or Gram-negative categorization due to its unique chemical properties. Despite having a peptidoglycan layer in its cell wall akin to Gram-positive bacteria, it doesn't readily take up the Gram stain, often resulting in faintly stained or 'ghost' cells - a telltale sign of the presence of Mycobacteria in a Gram-stained specimen. MTB is a substantial rod-shaped bacillus, measuring 0.2-0.5 x 2-4 µm. To visualize MTB in a sputum specimen under a microscope with 1000X magnification, the sample needs to have a concentration exceeding 10,000 bacilli per ml. A single acid-fast bacillus detected per slide raises suspicion of an MTB infection. Cord factor, also known as trehalose dimycolate, is a glycolipid component of MTB's cell wall. This compound causes the MTB bacilli to arrange themselves into elongated, slender serpentine cords - a characteristic that lends the cord factor its name. Notably toxic to mammalian cells, the cord factor impedes the migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and is predominantly produced in virulent strains of MTB.MTB's cell wall, rich in lipids due to the presence of mycolic acid, prevents it from retaining conventional bacteriological stains. Thus, Ziehl-Neelsen staining or acid-fast staining is employed, in which the acid-fast bacilli are rendered pink against a contrasting backdrop. MTB is a facultative intracellular parasite, primarily of macrophages, and exhibits a slow generation time of 15-20 hours - a trait potentially contributing to its virulence.", "Description: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), the causative agent of tuberculosis in humans, is an obligate aerobe that typically resides in the well-aerated upper lobes of the lungs. MTB is a small, slightly curved rod-shaped bacillus, which may be found individually or in groups. Its characteristic as a facultative intracellular parasite of macrophages and a slow generation time of 15-20 hours are believed to contribute to its virulence. This growth rate is slow compared to other bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, which divides approximately every 20 minutes. MTB has a notable resistance to weak disinfectants and can survive in a dry state for several weeks. This resilience is likely due to its unusual cell wall, rich in lipids such as mycolic acid, which is a key virulence factor. Mycobacterium tuberculosis's growth is slow, and it may take up to six weeks for visible growth in a culture. The presence of mycolic acid in the cell wall gives the bacterium its acid-fast properties.", "Manifestations: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is the bacterium responsible for causing tuberculosis (TB) in humans, who are the only reservoir for this pathogen. It is a significant health concern globally, being the leading bacterial infectious disease, affecting about one-third of the world population, approximately 1.8 billion people, annually. TB primarily attacks the lungs but can affect other parts of the body like the kidneys, spine, and brain. It spreads from person to person through the air when an infected individual with active TB in the lungs or throat coughs, sneezes, talks, or sings, releasing bacteria into the environment. It does not spread through physical contact, shared food or drink, or using the same bed linens or toilet seats. There are two TB-related conditions: latent TB and active TB. In latent TB, the bacteria live in the body without causing illness. The infected person doesn't feel sick, show symptoms, or spread the bacteria. However, if the bacteria become active and multiply, the person progresses from latent TB to active TB disease. In active TB, the bacteria multiply in the body, causing sickness and potential transmission of the bacteria to others. While many with latent TB never develop the disease, others may get sick shortly after infection or years later when their immune system weakens due to another reason. People with weakened immune systems, particularly those with HIV, are at higher risk for developing TB. The complex waxes and cord factor in MTB help it evade destruction by lysosomes and macrophages, which contributes to its pathogenicity. If TB is not properly treated, it can be fatal.", "Laboratory Diagnosis: The detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) entails multiple diagnostic procedures: 1. **Microscopy:** Fastest diagnostic approach involving standard light microscopy and fluorescent microscopy. In AFB (acid-fast bacilli) staining, MTB appears as red-pink bacilli. Fluorescent staining techniques, such as rhodamine auramine or acridine orange, make the bacilli appear yellow-orange under UV light. 2. **Culture:** This more sensitive approach involves treating samples with NaOH, followed by centrifugation, and inoculating in a protein-rich medium like Lowenstein-Jensen or Middlebrook medium. After incubation at 37°C for up to 8 weeks, MTB forms dry, creamy colonies. Further identification involves biochemical tests including the niacin test, nitrate reductase test, and urease test, among others.3. **Molecular Diagnosis:** Due to MTB's slow growth rate, molecular techniques like Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAAT) are crucial for rapid TB detection. NAATs like PCR and others can identify MTB and provide information about drug resistance within a few hours or days. The GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay, for instance, simultaneously detects MTB DNA and resistance to rifampin in less than 2 hours. 4. **Antigen detection:** MTB antigen detection, such as Lipoarabinomannan (LAM), provides direct TB evidence, useful in rapid detection in various body fluids. 5. **Indirect methods:** These include tuberculin skin testing (TST) and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs), identifying immune responses to MTB. Both tests can be positive in latent and active TB, necessitating further evaluation for active disease presence. The IGRA assay measures interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production stimulated by MTB antigens, like Early Secretory Antigen Target 6 (ESAT-6) and Culture Filtrate Protein 10 (CFP-10).");
